## Overview

### The challenge

The users will be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- The hover states will be seen fro all interective elements on the page.

### What I learned

Still worked on my use of flex box and css grid. I learnt how to make the underline animation on the links when the mouse is hovered over it as it's something I have never done before.

Here is a snippet on how I was able to solve the problem:

```css
.footer_link:is(:link, :visited) {
  color: var(--white);
  font-size: var(--fs-10);
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
}

.footer_link::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  display: inline-block;
  background-color: var(--white);
  width: 0;
  height: 1px;
  left: 50%;
  bottom: -1px;
  transition: all 0.4s;
}

.footer_link:is(:hover, :active, :focus)::after {
  width: 50%;
}

.footer_link::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  display: inline-block;
  width: 0;
  right: 50%;
  bottom: -1px;
  height: 1px;
  transition: all 0.4s;
  background-color: var(--white);
}

.footer_link:is(:hover, :active, :focus)::before {
  width: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I would surely keep learning and improving on my use of flexbox and grid to make layouts and even more complex one as well. I would also need to get more comfortable with makimg the layouts much better with the use of media queries.

### Useful resources
